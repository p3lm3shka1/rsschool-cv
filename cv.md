My name is Vitalij Lazarev. 
You can contact me by several ways: e-mail: edovsky@hotmail.com. In discord: pelmeshka#1980. Or just by phone: +37062487720. 
I want you to teach me how to be Junior JS Developer. 
What about myself? I am usual gamer, sorry:) I like to play games in my free time because now I'm woking in Teleperformance LT as a Social Media Moderator. 
I have zero skills in programming and that's why I'm here so you can teach me. 
I don't have ones, sorry about that. But I will have some after some time after some stuying. 
I will gain experience here. I will. 
I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Aided design. Had a pleasure to learn some AutoCad with 3D graphics in engeneering modeling.
